You should have received an email from Le Wagon inviting you to sign up on [Kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com) (our learning platform). When submitting your onboarding form on Kitt, you should have received two additional invitations:

- One from Slack, inviting you to the Le Wagon Alumni slack community (where you'll chat with your buddies and all the previous alumni). Click on **Join** and fill the information.
- One from GitHub, inviting you to `lewagon` team. **Accept it** otherwise you won't be able to access the lecture slides.

If you haven't, please contact your teaching team.
